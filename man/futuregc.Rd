Function to Predict Future GC Factor
}
\description{
Function to predict future genomic control (GC) factor through simulations given the GWAS study sample size.
}
\usage{
futuregc(est,n,nsim=1,M=953834,seeds=123)
}
\arguments{
  \item{\code{est}}{parameter estimates by fitting either 2-component model, i.e., (pic, sigmasq, a); or 3-component model, i.e., (pic, p1, sigmasq1, sigmasq2, a).}
  \item{\code{n}}{specifided future GWAS sample size.}
  \item{\code{nsim}}{total number of simulations. By default, it is 1.}
  \item{\code{M}}{total number of SNPs in the reference panel. By default, it is the total number of common SNPs in Hapmap3 reference panel, which is equal to 953834. }
  \item{\code{seeds}}{numeric; random seeds used in simulation. By default, it is 123.}
}
\details{
This function allows to predict future genomic control (GC) factor through simulations. It will first generate joint effect size according to the fitted model; then get the marginal effect size by the LD structure across SNPs; then errors following a multivariate normal with mean zero and variance of the LD correlation matrix are added to get the estimates of the marginal effect sizes. The predicted GC factor is then calculated based on the simulated estimates of marginal effect sizes. (corresponding with Supplementary Table 9 in Zhang et. al 2018)
