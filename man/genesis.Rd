\arguments{
  \item{\code{summarydata}}{summay-level GWAS data, containing 3 columns: 
  SNP (SNP rsID), 
  Z (GWAS test z-statistic), 
  N (GWAS study sample size which can be different for different SNPs)}
  \item{\code{filter}}{logical; if TRUE, the input summary data will be filtered.}
  \item{\code{modelcomponents}}{2 or 3, indicating fitting a 2-component or 3-component model.}
  \item{\code{cores}}{number of CPU threads in parallel computing.}

  \item{\code{c0}}{an assumed maximum number of underlying susceptibility SNPs tagged by any individual GWAS marker. By default, c0 is set at 10.}

  \item{\code{qqplot.nsim}}{the total number of simulations to generate the expected p-values to get the QQ plot. By default, it is 100.}
  \item{\code{summaryGWASdata.save}}{logical; if TRUE, the filtered summary GWAS data after merged with the LD information will be saved as a dataframe.}
  \item{\code{qqplotdata.save}}{logical; if TRUE, the simulated data  to generate the QQ plot will be saved.}

\details{
If filter==TRUE, the input summary data will be filtered by 3 steps: (i) If sample size varies from SNP to SNP, remove SNPs with an effective sample size less than 0.67 times the 90th percentile of sample size. (ii) Remove SNPs within the major histocompatibility complex (MHR) region; filter SNPs to Hapmap3 SNPs. (iii) Remove SNPs with extremely large effect sizes (chi^2 > 80).

This function allows to estimate effect size distribution by fitting a 2- or 3-component model based on summary-level statistics as well as external linkage disequilibrium (LD) information. Unless users specify their own LD reference panel, the  default LD reference panel provided in this package  is 953834 common SNPs in Hapmap3. The LD score and Nstar are calculated based on 9 combinations of LD window size and r^2 threshold.  

This function also has an option to draw the QQ plot comparing observed distributions of association statistics against those expected under the fitted models. The QQ plot will allow the users to visually assess the goodness fit of the model.
