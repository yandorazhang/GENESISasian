\title{
Function to Calculate Number of SNPs with Effect Size Absolute Value Falling in an Interval
}
\description{
This function calculates the number of SNPs with the absolute value of effect size falling into some interval according to the fitted mixture model.
}
\usage{
numInterval(lower,upper,est,M=953834)
}
\arguments{
  \item{\code{lower}}{the lower bound of the interval.}
  \item{\code{upper}}{the upper bound of the interval.}
  \item{\code{est}}{the parameter estimates by fitting either 2-component model, i.e., (pic, sigmasq, a); or 3-component model, i.e., (pic, p1, sigmasq1, sigmasq2, a).}
  \item{\code{M}}{total number of SNPs in the reference panel. By default, it is the total number of common SNPs in Hapmap3 reference panel, which is equal to 953834. }
}
\details{
This function calculates the number of SNPs with the absolute value of effect size falling into some interval according to the fitted mixture model. (corresponding with Supplementary Table 7 in Zhang et. al 2018)
}
\value{
The number of SNPs with effect size falling into some interval (lower, upper) according to the fitted mixture model.
